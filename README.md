BrainBite Business Management – Improved Workflow

Project Overview

Hello! I’m the  Business Analyst who helped improve how BrainBite works on its projects. 
BrainBite is an educational technology platform designed for children (about 6 years old and up). 
It uses smart AI to adapt learning to each child’s pace, making lessons fun, engaging, and personalized to what each kid needs. 
BrainBite’s goal is to let kids learn at their own speed in a way that keeps them interested and helps them grow.I was brought in to help BrainBite’s team work together better. The team is remote and cross-functional, which means members are from different areas: some are developers, some are UI/UX designers, others handle marketing, and there are QA (Quality Assurance) specialists too. They all work from different places. 

My job was to streamline their project management – basically, help them keep track of tasks, communicate better, and stay organized so that the BrainBite platform can continue to improve smoothly.
Challenges Faced

When I started, I observed several problems in BrainBite’s workflow that were holding the team back. Here are the main challenges we discovered (don’t worry if you’re not familiar with business terms – I’ll explain each in simple terms):

Tasks Weren’t Updated: The team used a tool called Trello to list tasks, but it was rarely updated. This means people often forgot to mark tasks as done or in progress, so nobody was really sure what work was finished or what was left. It was like having a to-do list that no one checked off, causing confusion about progress.

No Clear Priorities: There was no system to prioritize tasks or estimate time for them. This made it hard to know which tasks were most urgent or important. Sometimes, a critical bug that needed fixing would get ignored while someone worked on a less important feature, simply because priorities weren’t clear.

Little Tracking or Visibility: Because updates were infrequent, the client and team members couldn’t easily see the project’s status. Imagine trying to follow a school project but nobody ever gives a status update – it’s hard to know if things are on track. This lack of visibility made it difficult to maintain momentum; the client felt left in the dark about what was being developed.

Poor Cross-Team Coordination: Each department (design, marketing, development, QA, etc.) kind of worked in its own bubble. Coordinating tasks and deadlines across different departments was messy. This led to misalignment – for example, marketing might plan a campaign for a feature that the development team hadn’t finished yet. The various parts of the project weren’t syncing up, and goals were getting misaligned as a result.


These challenges made BrainBite’s project progress slower and more frustrating than it needed to be. I knew i needed to fix these issues to help the team work better together and to give the client confidence that the project was under control.

Solutions Implemented
To tackle the above problems, I introduced a few key solutions. I’ll walk you through what I did step by step (in plain language):

Evaluating the Current Workflow: First, I took a close look at how things were currently being done. I observed team meetings and how tasks moved (or didn’t move) on Trello. By watching and taking notes, I pinpointed the holes in their process – for example, I noticed that Trello cards (tasks) weren’t being updated and there were no deadlines on them. This evaluation gave me a clear picture of what was broken.

Organizing Trello and Creating Guides: Next, I reorganized their task board on Trello. I set up specific sections (columns) for each stage of work (like “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Done”) and made sure each department had its own area to manage its tasks. I also wrote a simple guide or manual for the team explaining how to use Trello properly: how to add time estimates to tasks, update the status of a task as soon as you start or finish it, and mark high-priority tasks. This way, everyone had clear instructions on keeping Trello up-to-date. It’s a bit like giving everyone the same playbook so they know the rules of the game.

Introducing Scrum (Agile Project Management): I introduced the team to something called Scrum, which is a style of working under the Agile methodology. If you’ve never heard of Scrum: think of it as breaking a big project into small, manageable pieces and time periods. Rather than one giant deadline, you work in short cycles (often 1 or 2 weeks long) called “sprints.” For BrainBite, we started using Scrum to prioritize 
tasks and move faster. I helped the team write user stories (simple, one-sentence descriptions of a feature or task from the end-user’s perspective) and set clear goals for each sprint. This meant everyone knew exactly what we planned to get done in the next week or two and why it was important.

Putting the Scrum Framework in Action: It’s one thing to talk about Scrum and another to actually do it. So, I configured Trello to support Scrum. We created a backlog on Trello (a big list of all tasks and features we might work on eventually). Then we set up a sprint board that would contain only the tasks we plan to do in the current sprint. Each department’s Trello board was organized with Scrum in mind: for example, the development team’s board had columns for each step of their workflow (backlog, in progress, code review, done, etc.). We made sure all tasks had owners (someone responsible for them) and that they moved from one step to the next in Trello as the work progressed. Essentially, Trello became a live reflection of our Scrum process – you could open the board and immediately see what stage every task was in.

Frequent Sprint Meetings and Daily Stand-Ups: To boost communication, I set up regular meetings. At the start of each sprint, we have a sprint planning meeting where the team decides which tasks to tackle next (pulled from that backlog, with the most urgent ones first). Then, every day, I ran a daily stand-up – this is a very short meeting (about 15 minutes) where each team member says: what they worked on yesterday, what they are working on today, and if they have any blockers or problems. These daily check-ins made sure everyone was on the same page and no one was stuck silently. At the end of the sprint, we’d do a sprint review (to demo what was done to the client) and a retrospective (to talk about what went well or what we should improve for next time). These might sound like a lot of meetings, but each has a clear purpose and they replaced a lot of confusion with clarity. With everyone talking regularly, misunderstandings went down and teamwork went up.

Constant Monitoring and Feedback: Finally, I established a habit of continuous monitoring. This means I kept an eye on the Trello boards every day and checked in with team members often. If I noticed a high-priority task wasn’t being updated, I’d politely remind or ask the person responsible if they needed any help. We also made it safe for team members to give feedback – for instance, if a process wasn’t working for them, they could tell me and we’d adjust. 
This constant vigilance and open communication helped us react quickly to any problem. If something wasn’t working or if the client suddenly needed a change, we found out sooner rather than later. It also kept everyone focused on what mattered most to the client, since I would frequently loop back any client feedback to the team. In short, no more “set it and forget it” – we stayed adaptive and responsive throughout the project.

By implementing all these solutions, we created a much more structured and transparent way of working. I described it to the team like laying down some “rails” for a train – now their project had a clear track to run on, so it couldn’t easily go off course or get lost.

Results Achieved
The changes above had a huge positive impact on BrainBite’s workflow. Here are the key improvements we noticed (explained in simple terms):

Improved Task Visibility & Accountability: Now the client and every team member can see every task and its status in Trello, anytime. Nothing is hiding or getting forgotten. Because we reorganized Trello and everyone updates their tasks frequently, it’s always clear what’s going on. This visibility means people feel more responsible for their tasks – after all, everyone else can see if something is stuck or overdue! The team became more accountable, making sure to update their progress since they knew others (including the client) were watching in a supportive way.

Better Time Management & Prioritization: With Scrum in place, we gave every task a priority and an estimated time. This helped the team focus on high-priority tasks first and manage their time well. For example, critical bug fixes (which are high priority) started getting done right away in the next sprint, instead of being postponed. By finishing urgent tasks faster, we avoided delays in the project. The overall workflow became more efficient because people always knew what the most important thing to work on was.

Simplified Collaboration & Communication: The introduction of daily stand-ups and regular sprint meetings really brought the team together, even though they work remotely. Communication became routine and open. Instead of long email threads or confusion, team members now talk briefly every day and coordinate easily across departments. This means a UI designer knows what the developer is doing, the developer knows what marketing needs for an upcoming feature launch, and so on. The whole team is pulling in the same direction, which has made collaboration smoother and problems get solved faster. If an issue comes up, it’s raised in the morning stand-up and fixed that day, rather than lingering unnoticed.

Faster Delivery & Consistent Progress: By working in sprints (short cycles), the team started delivering pieces of the project on a regular basis. This steady rhythm led to meeting project milestones on schedule. Every sprint, something tangible was completed – so the client saw continuous progress (like a new feature or an improvement every couple of weeks). This not only kept BrainBite’s project on track but also built up the client’s trust and confidence in the team, because they could literally see things getting done regularly. We avoided the scary scenario of a deadline approaching with lots of unknowns; instead, we always had recent progress to show.

Higher Productivity & Efficiency: Perhaps the best outcome was that the team became much more productive. By eliminating the old chaos (unprioritized tasks, lack of updates, poor communication), everyone could spend their time actually doing the work that mattered. Morale went up too – it’s motivating to see your project moving forward smoothly. Using Scrum practices and having that feedback loop helped people continuously improve how they work. In the end, BrainBite’s team got more done in less time. This efficiency means BrainBite can take on more projects or build new features faster than before. The platform is now better positioned to grow and reach its goals, because the team has an effective workflow powering it.

These results were really rewarding for me personally to see. The team went from struggling with their process to having a clear, manageable system. It’s like watching a crew transform a messy workshop into a well-organized space – suddenly everything runs like clockwork!

How It Works (New Workflow Breakdown)
Now that I’ve described what changes we made, let me explain how the new project management workflow actually works on a day-to-day basis at BrainBite. Even if you’re not familiar with Agile or Scrum, you’ll get the idea:

Planning in Sprints: We organize work into sprints, which are short cycles (for BrainBite, about two weeks long). At the start of each sprint, I sit down with the team (virtually) for a sprint planning meeting. In this meeting, we look at the backlog – which is just a fancy word for the big master list of all tasks and ideas waiting to be done. We pick out a realistic number of tasks that we believe can be completed in the next two weeks. Importantly, we choose tasks based on priority: the most critical tasks (for example, fixing a major bug or finishing a feature the client needs ASAP) are taken first. We also discuss and estimate the effort each task will take (e.g., “This might take 3 days to finish” or “This is small, maybe a few hours”). By the end of this planning, everyone knows which tasks they will work on in the upcoming sprint and roughly how long they have to do them.

Prioritizing Tasks Clearly: In this new system, every task in Trello now has labels or markers for priority and due dates. For instance, a card (task) might have a red label that says “High Priority” or a note that it’s due by next Friday. Also, because we estimate time, a task might say “Estimate: 2 days” on it. This way, when a team member starts their day, they can quickly see which tasks are the most urgent. High-priority tasks are tackled first, and if anything urgent comes up unexpectedly, we adjust the sprint by possibly swapping out less important tasks. This clear prioritization ensures that no one is wasting time on something minor while an urgent issue sits unattended. It’s like doing your hardest homework first so you don’t accidentally spend all night on an easy assignment and miss the important one.

Daily Stand-Up Meetings: Every morning, the whole team gathers for a quick stand-up meeting (and yes, originally teams literally stood up to keep it short – around 15 minutes). In this meeting, each person gives a brief update: what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and if there’s any obstacle in their way. For example, a developer might say, “Yesterday I finished the login feature, today I will start on the profile page, but I’m waiting on the UI design for it.” Immediately, the designer knows they need to hurry on that UI design. These daily check-ins mean no one works in a silo. Everyone hears the status of everyone else’s tasks regularly. Problems (like “I’m stuck on X” or “Y is taking longer than expected”) are brought up early, often we solve them right in the meeting or shortly after. This keeps the sprint on track each day.

Trello Boards for Tracking: Trello is the tool we use to track all tasks, and it’s been set up to mirror our workflow. Each department has its own Trello board, and there’s also an overall project board. On these boards, tasks are represented by cards that move through columns. A typical set of columns might be: Backlog, To Do (this sprint), In Progress, In Review/Testing, Done. When a sprint starts, all the tasks chosen for that sprint move into the “To Do (this sprint)” column. Then, as team members work on a task, they drag its card to “In Progress,” and when it’s finished, into “Done.” This way, at any given moment, anyone can open Trello and see exactly how many tasks are in progress and what’s completed. We even gave the client access to view certain boards, so they have full transparency. It’s kind of like a big scoreboard for the project – very easy to read and always up to date.

Monitoring and Updates: Throughout the sprint, I (as the project manager) continuously monitor the Trello boards. I check if cards are not moving (which could mean someone is stuck or maybe forgot to update). If a card stays in “In Progress” longer than expected, I’ll reach out to that team member to ask if everything’s okay or if they need help. The tool itself also helps with monitoring: for example, Trello can show a due date in red if it’s overdue. I set up some notifications and reminders too – team members get reminders before a task’s due date, and I get notified if any high-priority task is past due. This constant monitoring isn’t about micromanaging, but about catching issues early. It’s much easier to solve a small problem today than a big problem at the end of the month. By keeping an eye on things daily, we ensure no task falls through the cracks.

Feedback and Adaptation: At the end of each sprint, we do two important things: a sprint review and a retrospective. In the sprint review, we show the client what has been completed. For example, if we added a new feature in the BrainBite app, we might do a quick demo. It’s a celebration of what’s done and an opportunity for the client to give immediate feedback (“I love it” or “Can we tweak this part?”). After that, in the retrospective (usually just the internal team), we talk openly about what went well and what could be better. Maybe we’ll realize “Our estimates were off, we took on too many tasks” or “Communication was great this sprint, let’s keep doing that daily check-in format.” We then use these lessons to improve the next sprint. This way, the workflow itself is continuously refined. The process adapts as the team finds what works best for them. It’s an ongoing learning experience, which keeps getting smoother over time.


In summary, the new workflow is cyclical and iterative. Plan → work → check-in → deliver → get feedback → improve, and then start again. It might sound like a lot of steps, but in practice it created a nice rhythm for the team. They always know what they should be doing and how it fits into the bigger picture. The stress level went down and productivity went up, because the chaos was replaced with a clear plan and open communication.

Visual Enhancements
To help everyone understand and embrace the new workflow, I also used visual tools and charts to make things clear. Sometimes a picture is easier to grasp than text, especially for showing progress or structure. 

Here I’ll share a couple of visuals (from our project management tool) and explain them in simple terms:

This is a snapshot of a Trello board organized into multiple lists (columns) for a project. 

![A](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f3f4db-2f22-4536-baf8-c9652475467d)

Each column represents a stage in the workflow. For example, you can see lists like “Backlog,” “On Deck,” “In Progress,” “Review/Waiting,” and “Done.” Each of those little boxes under the columns is a card, which stands for a task. As work happens, cards move from left to right (from Backlog all the way to Done). 

This kind of board gives the team an at-a-glance view of all tasks – you can instantly tell how many tasks are in progress and how many are completed. It’s like a digital bulletin board that shows the status of every piece of work. 

Even if you’ve never used Trello, you can look at this and intuitively understand that, say, the “Backlog” column has tasks waiting to be picked up, and the “Done” column on the far right has tasks that are finished.

These are dashboard charts that visualize task data.

On the left, the chart labeled “Cards per list” is a bar graph showing how many tasks are in each list of the Trello board. For instance, it might show a tall bar for the Backlog (meaning many tasks are waiting to be done) and smaller bars for “Done” (meaning fewer tasks are completed at the moment). 

This immediately highlights bottlenecks – if “In Progress” is overloaded with cards, we see it as a tall bar and know the team might be juggling too much at once. On the right, the “Cards per due date” chart shows tasks by their due dates status (like how many tasks are overdue, due soon, or have no due date). 

In the example, you can see a red bar for “Overdue” tasks and a gray bar for “No due date.” These charts gave us quick insights: if the Overdue bar grows, it’s a warning that deadlines are being missed; a large “No due date” bar might mean we forgot to assign deadlines to some tasks. By looking at these visuals, the team and I could easily monitor the health of our workflow without reading through every card. It’s a clear, at-a-glance way to ensure everything is on track.(The above images are examples similar to what we used in BrainBite’s project management. They helped turn data into a visual story – anyone could see where the project stood just by glancing at a board or chart.)


Writing this README in a personal way, I hope I managed to clearly convey how I helped transform BrainBite’s project management process. I took a chaotic situation with poor updates and communication, and I implemented a structured Agile workflow that made things simple, transparent, and efficient. 

The difference is night and day – now tasks are updated frequently, priorities are clear, every team member is in the loop, and the project is steadily chugging along like a well-oiled machine.I’m proud of how these changes not only improved productivity and coordination but also made the team happier and less stressed. It shows that with the right process (and a bit of patience teaching everyone how to use it), even a complex project can become manageable and even enjoyable. BrainBite’s team can now focus on what they do best – developing a great platform for kids – while the project management side runs smoothly in the background. In the end, seeing the team’s success and the platform’s progress gave me a “wow” moment as well, realizing how much of an impact a good workflow can have!
